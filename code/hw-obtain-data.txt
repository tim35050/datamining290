HW Obtain Data

I will be working with flight data.  More specifically, I'll be examining
airplane routes around the world.

## What are the types of data available to you?

I found flight data here: http://openflights.org/data.html.  Flight route
data is contained in a .dat file, which I downloaded using wget:

airbears2-10-142-156-100:code timothymeyers$ wget https://sourceforge.net/p/openflights/code/HEAD/tree/openflights/data/routes.dat?format=raw

I renamed my file using the command: 
mv routes.dat?format=raw routes.dat

I used the following command to get a preliminary look at the data:
Timothys-MacBook-Pro:code timothymeyers$ head routes.dat

2B,410,CEK,2968,OVB,4078,,0,CR2
2B,410,CSY,6162,DME,4029,,0,CR2

Here's Open Flights' explanantion of what each value in a row means:

Airline	2-letter (IATA) or 3-letter (ICAO) code of the airline.
Airline ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for airline (see Airline).
Source airport	3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the source airport.
Source airport ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for source airport (see Airport)
Destination airport	3-letter (IATA) or 4-letter (ICAO) code of the destination airport.
Destination airport ID	Unique OpenFlights identifier for destination airport (see Airport)
Codeshare	"Y" if this flight is a codeshare (that is, not operated by Airline, but another carrier), empty otherwise.
Stops	Number of stops on this flight ("0" for direct)
Equipment	3-letter codes for plane type(s) generally used on this flight, separated by spaces

The types of data are comma-separated values.

## For data sets: how many records are in the data set?

Timothys-MacBook-Pro:code timothymeyers$ wc -l routes.dat
   59637 routes.dat

There are 59637 records in the data set.

## Provide an "interesting" record, explain its properties and why it is interesting

The following reveals two records that have the greatest number of different
plane types that are generally used for the route:

Timothys-MacBook-Pro:code timothymeyers$ egrep ".{3} .{3} .{3} .{3} .{3} .{3} .{3} .{3} .{3} .{3} .{3}" routes.dat
US,5265,DEN,3751,IAH,3550,Y,0,752 320 738 739 E70 788 753 ERJ 319 73G 764
US,5265,IAH,3550,DEN,3751,Y,0,319 739 788 CR7 752 738 73G 320 753 764 ERJ

## What are 3 questions you could answer using your data?

Which airport in the world services the greatest number of outbound routes?

Which airport in the world services the greatest number of inbound routes?

Which airline offers the greatest number of different routes?
